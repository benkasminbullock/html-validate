This is a validator for HTML files which checks for unclosed tags,
tags which are nested but should not be, empty tags (tags with nothing
between the start and the finish) and whether the file is valid UTF-8.

The programming language is Go. There is a Makefile, but you can
probably build the binary by typing "go build" in this directory.

There are some tests in the t directory which are run using
run-tests.pl (Perl) in this directory.
